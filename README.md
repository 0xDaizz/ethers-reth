#Octane
A ether-rs middleware for reth that bypasses JSON-RPC allowing for faster db queries.

#Work in Progress!
Please note that Octane is currently in its early stages of development. 

## Todo:
[ ] Full log functionality: We're working on implementing comprehensive logging capabilities to help with debugging and monitoring.
[ ] Complete trace functionality
[ ] Integration with Anvil: We plan to integrate with Anvil to offer super-fast simulation in fork mode
[ ] Improved type conversions: The type conversion is a terroristic at best, we'll clean that up soon
