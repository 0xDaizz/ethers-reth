# Octane
A ether-rs middleware for reth that bypasses JSON-RPC allowing for faster db queries.

## Work in Progress!
Please note that Octane is currently in its early stages of development. 

## Todo:
- [ ] Full log functionality
- [ ] Full trace functionality
- [ ] Integration with Anvil: We plan to integrate with Anvil to offer super-fast simulation in fork mode
- [ ] Improved type conversions: The type conversion is terroristic at best, we'll clean that up soon
- [ ] Tests, waiting on node sync
