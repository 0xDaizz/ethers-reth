# Octane

A ether-rs middleware for reth that bypasses JSON-RPC allowing for faster db queries.

## Work in Progress!

Please note that Octane is currently in its early stages of development.

## Todo:

- [ ] Full log functionality
- [x] Full trace functionality
- [ ] Full debug functionality
- [ ] Full tx pool functionality
- [x] Integration with Anvil: We plan to integrate with Anvil to offer super-fast simulation in fork mode
- [x] Improved type conversions: The type conversion is terroristic at best, we'll clean that up soon
